# Cat fact web app

A web application that shows random cat facts on its main page.

## One-shot run

In the project directory run `go run .`. That's it!

Note that it requires the go module support (on by default in modern versions
of go, on an old version enable manually with the `GO111MODULE=on` environment
variable).

## Compile and run

In the project directory run `go build .`. This will create an executable file
`catfact_webapp`. Run it to start the web app.
