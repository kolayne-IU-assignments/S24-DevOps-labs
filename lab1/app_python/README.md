# Moscow time web app

A web application that shows current Moscow time on the main page.

## How to run

1.  (Optional) Create a virtual environment, e.g., by running
    `python3 -m venv venv`; activate it with `source venv/bin/activate`
    (may be different for your shell).

2.  Install requirements, e.g., by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
    (the requirements file is in the same directory with this file).

3.  Start the application, e.g., by running `python3 main.py`. The web application
    will become available at your `localhost` on the first free port starting with
    5000.

4.  Visit the main page, e.g., at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (may be different on your
    machine). Enjoy the Moscow time!
